# Contributing to Walrio

Walrio is an free and open-source project, it is possible and encouraged to participate in the development of this music player. You can also participate by answering questions, reporting bugs or helping with documentation. If you plan on submitting any code/modules/documentation updates, please try to follow the commit message and pull request styling used by recent commits until guidelines have been added here for those things.

At the moment all that is required code-wise is for each function to have a minimum of a 1-line comment explaining its function in any module and what any arguments/parameters do, and for files outside of the GUI files to be written in Python. 

Once more progress has been done this guide will be updated and documentation for what currently exits will be provided in order to make the contribution process easier.
